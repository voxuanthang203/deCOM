# deCOM - Decentralized E-Commerce Platform

## Inspiration
The economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy in the U.S. is immense, with the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) estimating losses up to $600 billion annually. deCOM is our solution to combat this issue, leveraging blockchain technology to establish a platform where buyers can confidently trust the authenticity of their purchases.

Our vision is to create a decentralized e-commerce platform that offers full transparency and accountability for buyers, sellers, and manufacturers. With deCOM, we aim to revolutionize online shopping by restoring trust in the global marketplace.

## What It Does
deCOM is a next-generation e-commerce platform operating in a decentralized environment. It enables:
- **Sellers** to prove product ownership through smart contracts, digital signatures, and immutable records.
- **Buyers** to verify product authenticity, ensuring they purchase only genuine items.
- **Manufacturers** to mint NFTs, showcasing unique product features and adding value. These NFTs are then available for purchase, fostering a marketplace where authenticity and quality are prioritized.

With deCOM, users can enjoy a secure, transparent, and efficient online shopping experience.
